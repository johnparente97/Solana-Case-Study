## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
	•	Solana is addressing the limitations of existing blockchain platforms, including slow transaction speeds, high fees, and limited throughput. They aim to provide a high-performance, scalable blockchain platform that can handle a high volume of transactions quickly and cost-effectively. (Solana Labs - Solana)
	•	Solana is a cutting edge blockchain that is pushing the narrative of tokenizing. Tokenization is the process of converting a real or tangible asset, such as real estate, art, stocks, or other physical or financial assets, into a digital token on a blockchain. These digital tokens represent ownership, or a share of the underlying asset. (Wikipedia - Tokenization)
	•	This new technology could aid in the task of taking account of international currencies. Over the last decade or so there’s been a trend for online fraud, whether it’s for credit cards or other payment solutions. Having transactions verified on the blockchain will be an accurate resource to track such incidents and their validity.
De
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
	•	Solana's intended customers are developers and projects looking to build decentralized applications (DApps) and services on their blockchain platform. They are also targeting the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and various other applications that require a fast and efficient blockchain infrastructure. (Solana Labs - Solana)

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
	•	“Some of the current leading blockchain technologies use energy-hogging, time-consuming mining — or solving very complex calculations — to validate security, and have fees that can range into the hundreds of dollars per transaction. Solana uses what’s called proof of stake to validate information — there’s no mining involved — and a special innovation called proof of history on top of that that allows it to validate even quicker. That makes it extremely efficient, using energy at the same scale as a few Google searches and significantly less energy than other regular household uses like running your refrigerator. Transaction fees, which are used to maintain blockchain networks and have ballooned elsewhere, are a fraction of a cent on Solana.” (Solana Labs - Blockchain Basics)
	•	Solana's unfair advantage is its unique combination of technologies, including the Proof of History (PoH) mechanism, a high-performance consensus algorithm, and a fast virtual machine for smart contracts. These technologies enable Solana to achieve high throughput and low transaction costs, which sets it apart from competitors in the blockchain space. (Solana Labs - Blockchain Basics)
